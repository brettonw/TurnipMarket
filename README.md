# Turnip Prices in Animal Crossing

The original source for this project is [Treeki/TurnipPrices.cpp](https://gist.github.com/Treeki/85be14d297c80c8b3c0a76375743325b), which appears to be a disassembled version of the actual game source.

If I was going to pursue this further, I would use this code to generate a large number of exemplars and train a neural network to recognize the individual patterns.

My assessment for a single player is that whatever price you buy at on Sunday, sell on Tuesday afternoon for the best overall return of about 10%. But really, don't bother with that at all - go online to the [Turnip Exchange](https://turnip.exchange) website and find a friend in Pattern 1 where the Turnip prices are 500+ Bells.
